## Docker Compose

Create a docker-compose.yml file. The '#' symbol comments out a line.

- version
Version of the docker-compose, specified for syntax purposes

- services
Docker image references

- build: '.'
Builds the image from the current directory. If both build and image are
specified, image will be used as it has a priority.

- ports
Exposes ports

- volumes
The preferred mechanism for persisting (saving) data generated by and used
by Docker containers.
Volumes are directories/files that are outside of the default Union File System
and exist as normal directories and files on the host filesystem.

- depends_on
Makes sure the dependency starts before the service for which it was specified.
This does not ensure a successful launch of the dependency, just makes sure
it starts up first.

- env_file
Specifies the name of a file where environment variable are stored. Make sure
to specify COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME to not get into naming conflicts when using
multiple applications.
